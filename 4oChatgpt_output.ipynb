      "\"Hey, I'm seeing some weird behavior with Thunderbird - several customers who use Zeelandnet as their email provider are unable to send emails from within the app. I've tried updating to the latest version (91.0.1) but that didn't fix the issue, so I rolled back to a previous one (78.9.1) and voila! It works again. What's interesting is that other mail apps like Outlook and Windows Mail are able to send emails just fine on these same machines with the same settings - it seems to be specific to Thunderbird and Zeelandnet. The error message I'm seeing says something about an unknown reason preventing the email from being sent via the SMTP server (mail.zeelandnet.nl) on port 465, which is secured with SSL and a regular password. For me, it's all good if I downgrade the app version, but clearly that's not a solution for anyone else. The goal here should be to send an email without error - instead, I get this message: 'Sending failed. The message cannot be sent via the outgoing (SMTP) server mail.zeelandnet.nl for unknown reasons. Check your outgoing (SMTP) server settings and try again.'\"\n",

The problem is that when you're using Firefox and have Enhanced Site Protection set to strict, the whole thing breaks down. What happens is that you navigate to your HA dashboard, then try to access something served via Ingress - say, an iframe pointing at `/api/hassio_ingress/<ingress ID>`.

It just shows a 401 Unauthorized error instead. I've checked the request headers, and they're fine - the issue is that the cookie isn't being sent. When I turn off Enhanced Site Protection, everything works as expected.

Essentially, if you have a flex item in a column box that has a percentage-based height (like \"flex: 1 0 100%\"), it doesn't re-layout when the dimensions change. This becomes even more wonky if there's a sibling element with a maximum height specified, because then it does get a second layout pass and things look different. I attached an example file that shows what I mean - if you check out the two examples side by side, they don't match up like they should. My expectation was that they'd be identical, but instead, one of them is missing some visual elements because it didn't get that second layout pass.\n",

Then, follow these steps: open the browser with that profile, navigate to 'about:logins', click on the 'Sort by:' dropdown menu, select either 'Username(A-Z)' or 'Username(Z-A)', and observe the login list. What I expect to happen is that all my saved logins would be correctly sorted, but instead, nothing happens. It's not just me, though - this issue only started showing up with builds from a certain range (d97a050c677e87913002d60f92d811a175e022d4 to 6bb6be51f4fa1ad7f5741e98cc0749c76f4126b3). I think the patch for Bug 1592682 might be the culprit. Attached is a screen recording of the issue if you want to see it in action.\"\n",

      "\"I've found a weird issue with the way Firefox handles transitions on the `<html>` element. To reproduce it, you can create a webpage where the HTML element is constrained to be smaller than the viewport (like setting its width and height to 100px each), then add a transition effect to its background property that lasts for 5 seconds or so. Finally, use some JavaScript code to change the background color of the HTML element. What happens next is pretty strange: when you run the codepen demo I created here https://codepen.io/eritbh/pen/QWvPzJj, you'll notice that the transition doesn't seem to update the canvas area outside the boundaries of the `<html>` element - it's like the browser is just ignoring those parts. If you move your mouse cursor around in that area, the area might get updated periodically during the transition period, but only sometimes. The behavior changes depending on the opacity levels involved in the transition too. For example, when transitioning between blue and black, it behaves one way, but when transitioning from transparent to black, it does something different. Even when I move my mouse constantly to try and trigger redraws, the color outside the root element updates at a slower pace than the color inside. My expectation is that the background of the canvas area should transition smoothly along with the HTML element's background, without needing me to move my cursor around to make it happen - which is what happens in Chrome and Edge, by the way.\"\n",

      "\"I've got a weird issue with HTML element transitions that I'm hoping you can help me track down. So, here's what's happening: if I constrain the size of the root `<html>` element to be smaller than the viewport (like by setting `width` and `height` to specific values), then add a transition to its `background` property, and finally change the background through JavaScript - well, it just doesn't seem to work as expected. Specifically, when I apply this transition, the area outside the bounded `<html>` element doesn't actually update in sync with the transition - it's like the canvas is frozen or something! Now, if I move my cursor around in that area, it'll occasionally repaint itself, but only sporadically during the transition period. It's a bit finicky, too - the behavior changes depending on the opacities involved in the transition. I've put together a CodePen demo to illustrate the issue: check it out at https://codepen.io/eritbh/pen/QWvPzJj. To make matters more confusing, when you're dealing with transparent colors in the transition, even mouse movement can't seem to keep up - the color outside the root element updates at a different pace than the one inside! I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what's going on here and how we can get this transition to behave smoothly.

      "So, I've got this weird issue going on in Firefox Nightly - it happens across different platforms like Windows 10, macOS, and Linux Mint. First off, you need to have some specific settings enabled: set \"browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.devtoolsEnabled\" to true in the about:config page, and also turn on a custom theme from the Themes tab in about:addons. Once that's done, here's what I do to trigger this bug: open up Firefox with that profile, head to the about:newtab#asrouter page, and then click on the \"Targeting\" section. From there, search for the \"userEnabledActiveColorway\" parameter - when you look at its value, it's supposed to say \"false\". But what actually happens is that this parameter just shows up empty, with no value at all! It's like it doesn't even exist.

      "So, I'm trying to reproduce this issue on an Ubuntu live USB (22.04.1 LTS) and it happens just like that: I boot into the OS, connect to the internet, update Firefox using `sudo snap refresh firefox`, open up the browser, and then navigate to Wikipedia's main page at https://www.wikipedia.org/. What I see is a blank page for a few seconds while this blue progress bar bounces around - it's like Firefox is stuck or something. Then, suddenly, the page loads quickly after that delay. When I looked into it further using some profiler tool, I found out that most of the time is being spent on this `FcConfigCompareValue` function from `libfontconfig.so.1`. The weird thing is, this slow performance doesn't happen in other browsers like Chromium - so it seems to be a Firefox-specific issue. What should happen instead is that the page loads quickly without any delay; no blue bar bouncing around and no blank screen for seconds.\n",

When you try to delete an empty line by pressing backspace, it doesn't actually remove the line like it should. Instead, it just removes the last character of the previous line. It's like the backspace key is getting stuck or something!

      "\"So, I've noticed this weird thing happening with Firefox - and it's not just me! It happens on Windows 10, 7, and even Ubuntu. The issue is with Private Browsing mode. Here's what I did to reproduce it: I launched a new profile, opened up a few tabs on different websites, then closed Firefox altogether. Then, I right-clicked the icon in the taskbar/dock (or whatever you call it on Ubuntu) and selected \"New private window\" to start fresh. But here's the thing - instead of just starting with a blank slate, I still see this \"Open Previous Tabs\" pop-up asking if I want to restore my previous session. And that's weird because when I'm in Private Browsing mode, I'd expect all my history and whatnot to be wiped clean, right?

It's actually kind of unpredictable when it'll happen, but essentially, if you zoom in, the tab will crash more often than not. For more info and a crash dump (if we're lucky), check out bug #1720650 comment 14 - the backtraces in the console look similar to what was reported there. The only thing is that most of these crashes don't leave any useful crash dumps, but when I do see one, it looks like the same issue from before.

      "So, I've got this issue with an extension called Imagus that lets me enlarge images and view them/videos just by hovering over the link with my mouse. The problem is, sometimes (like, most of the time) it stops showing the image if I don't move my cursor after hovering on the link. It's like it needs some kind of confirmation that I'm still interested in seeing the image before it actually shows up. For example, if I hover over an image link and just freeze my mouse right there, a white pop-up frame will appear but the actual image won't show. But if I move my cursor even just a tiny bit, the image usually pops up fine. This only happens with certain types of images, though - some smaller ones don't have this issue.

      "\"So, we're privacy researchers trying to evaluate the risks of browser caching mechanisms. We've found a pretty concerning issue with Firefox 92.0.1 - it looks like cached requests from cross-origin resources (CORS) can actually be used to track users across private browsing sessions. Here's how it works: imagine you visit a website that loads some content from another domain, and the browser caches that request. If you close that private window and open a new one, those cached requests can still be used to load the same content without needing to make a new request. That means an attacker could essentially encode a unique identifier into a series of CORS requests, allowing them to track your activity across different browsing sessions - even if you're using private mode. It works like this: the browser remembers when it's seen certain bits of data before (CORS cache HIT=1), and doesn't bother making a new request for that stuff again (CORS cache MISS=0). The issue is that this identifier can persist across private browsing sessions, which is a pretty big deal from a privacy perspective. In our testing, we found that when you close and re-open the private window, the cached CORS requests don't get cleared - they just stick around and keep causing problems. So, to fix this, Firefox should probably clear those caches when the private window is closed, so that new browsing sessions start from a clean slate.\"\n",

      "\"So, I was testing my extension and noticed something weird. Here's what happened: I set up a news account and subscribed to some groups, then I copied the link location of an article from the message list context menu. Next, I started composing a new plain text message, inserted the link and some text around it, saved it as a draft, and then started composing another message in HTML format. Then, I opened up that first plain text message from my drafts folder, selected the text with the link, copied it (not the actual URL), and pasted it into the second HTML message, making sure to check that the link still had the `news:` scheme. After saving the second message as a draft too, when I went back to open it, I noticed that the link got converted to a `mailbox:` one instead of keeping its original `news:` scheme - and even worse, the link text was still showing up as `news:...`. This can be reproduced in Thunderbird version 105, which is pretty frustrating because there's no point in sending messages with those kinds of links. What I expected to happen is that the `news:` URI scheme would be preserved when I saved the message as a draft - it seems like a simple thing, but it makes a big difference!\"\n",

The funny thing is, if I download an old CR2 file instead (like these samples: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-70d/beispielaufnahmen.html or https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/9485291827/canon-eos-5d-mark-iv-sample-gallery/7296166408), Firefox doesn't have a problem with it. But when I download a CR3 file, suddenly it thinks it's an MP4 video and changes the extension accordingly. Anyways, my expectation is that the downloaded file should just be a simple .CR3 file, not some video file.\"\n",

What happens is that whenever you download one of these files, Firefox decides to change the file extension from .CR3 to .mp4 - which is super confusing! To reproduce this bug, all you gotta do is: 1) Download a CR3 file (like from these sample galleries I found: https://www.dkamera.de/testbericht/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii/beispielaufnahmen.html or https://www.dpreview.com/sample-galleries/3577431182/canon-rf-28-70mm-f2-l-sample-gallery-dpreview-tv/9300505795); 2) Save it; and 3) Check the file - you'll find that Firefox has automatically changed the extension to .mp4 (see attached screenshot). For comparison, if I download a CR2 file (which is Canon's older RAW format), Firefox doesn't have this issue. But with CR3 files specifically, it seems like Firefox is stuck on thinking they're video files or something! So, my expectation would be that the downloaded file should just have the original .CR3 extension - but instead, I get a mysterious .mp4 file.\"\n",

When I download a CR3 file (which is a RAW image format), Firefox automatically changes the file extension to .mp4 instead of keeping it as .CR3.

      "\"So, I've been experiencing this weird issue with Firefox where the tooltips get all bolded and blurry when I'm using my external 1080 LG monitor (which is connected to my MacBook) - this happens specifically when I have the Dark theme turned on. It's not just that they're a bit fuzzy, they're actually super bold too! The weirdest part is that if I hover over a button on my native MacBook monitor, the tooltips are still bolded, but at least they don't get blurry like they do on the external monitor. I've checked with other versions of Firefox (91.0, 92.0b2, and 93.0a1) and it's only happening in these specific versions. I'm on macOS 10.13, just FYI. I've also tried reproducing this issue on newer Mac OS versions (10.14 and 10.15), but it only shows up on the older one, which is a bit strange.

      "\"I've got a weird issue happening with Firefox 93+ when I'm trying to type over some selected text inside an editable element. The repro case can be seen at this CodePen pen: https://codepen.io/Bwrrp/pen/ExvYLwZ, and I've also attached it here. Here's what happens: if you put your cursor at the end of a block of text, after a period, for example, and then press Shift-Home to select the whole line, then try typing a letter - in Firefox 92 or earlier, the selected text gets replaced with the new letter. But starting from Firefox 93, nothing happens; the selection just stays there. When I'm using the Japanese IME built into Windows 10, set to Hiragana mode, composition does start, but the selected text still doesn't get removed and the initial composition text isn't visible - it's like the two are stuck together. The IME window sometimes pops up in an unexpected place too, overlapping with the text. If I keep typing away in this way, I end up prepending new text rather than overwriting the selection, which is what used to happen correctly in Firefox 92 and earlier. What I'm expecting is that the typed letter should immediately replace the selected text, whether or not composition is involved. Interestingly, if I swap out the custom-element tag for a regular div, this issue goes away - it only happens when there's an unknown element and some nested inline elements mixed in.\"\n",

And it wasn't just that - after clicking the \"Manage Exceptions\" button, the page even stopped scrolling for a bit. Apparently, it was because of an old cookie permission setting from 2017 that had this obscure value `9` which was used for something called `ACCESS_ALLOW_FIRST_PARTY_ONLY`. It seems like some localization routine in Firefox freaked out when it saw that value and threw an exception (see comment 5). The result was the whole dialog getting nerfed. I'm guessing others with old profiles might have similar issues, especially those who actively manage their cookies - they might have saved obsolete values in the site permissions database.

      "So, there was this one issue where someone had an old cookie permission set up on their site permissions database that basically broke the \"manage exceptions\" dialog for cookies. It wouldn't even show up! The weird thing is that it was because they had a legacy cookie permission with a capability value of 9, which used to be tied to ACCESS_ALLOW_FIRST_PARTY_ONLY back in 2017. When the localization routine tried to deal with this old permission, it threw an exception (see comment 5) because it only expected values like 0, 1, or 2.

      "So, I've got an issue with Firefox - specifically with syncing tabs on the toolbar. It seems like when I right-click on the toolbar and select \"Customize toolbar...\", drag the \"Synced Tabs\" item onto the toolbar, and then click \"Done\", the button for synced tabs doesn't have a label anymore. Normally, you'd expect to see something like \"Sign in to sync...\" - but instead it's just blank.

      "\"Hey, I was messing around with the tracking protection feature on my Firefox browser (version 92.0) and noticed something weird. So, when you click that little icon to toggle tracking protection on/off, a toast popup appears - no biggie. But then, here's where it gets funky: after about three seconds, that popup just poofs away without any fade-out animation like normal panels do. I mean, it's like the popup is gone before you can even blink! I think this might be because of how the script handles hiding the popup - instead of using `this._protectionsPopup.hidePopup(true)`, it uses some other method (`PanelMultiView.hidePopup(this._protectionsPopup)`). Anyways, when I changed that one line to use the right method, the problem went away. So yeah, I think it'd be a good idea to swap out that line of code and make the popup disappear with a nice fade-out animation instead.\"\n",

When I click the icon and toggle it on, the toast popup appears like normal - it slides down from the top 70px or so.

      "\"I'm using Firefox 103.0.2 on Ubuntu 20.04 with Wayland, and I ran into a weird issue when trying to comment on a Github issue. I took a screenshot, saved it to my local /tmp/ directory, and tried to add it to the Markdown comment form textarea by dragging and dropping it from Nautilus. The problem is that Github only gives you the option to drag and drop files directly into that field, with no file upload button or chooser - so I figured I'd try the drag-and-drop route. But when I dropped the PNG file onto the textarea, nothing happened! Firefox just ignored it like it was invisible. I had to end up copying the image to my Downloads folder and then dragging it from there for it to work properly.

It happens on multiple platforms - macOS 12.5.1, Windows 10 x64, and Ubuntu 20.04 x64. To reproduce it, you need to have the browser installed and opened, with a specific preference set (\"browser.aboutwelcome.templateMR\" should be true). Here's what I do: restart the browser, go to the \"about:welcome\" page, click \"Skip this step\" until you get to the \"Import Data\" screen, then just look at the \"Skip this step\" button in the bottom-right corner. What I expect is that it shows up with its label, but instead, I get a tiny gray button without any text - it's like it's gone invisible! Now, when I used some debugging tools to figure out what went wrong, I found that the issue started showing up after a certain point in time (around August 21st).

      "\"Hey, so I've been having some issues with Firefox since the 20220813 nightly build. What happens is that after 0-30 minutes of using it, my browser basically stops working - at least when it comes to one specific domain (let's call it Domain X). When I try to access anything on that domain, nothing loads and it just keeps spinning forever. Meanwhile, other domains are still fine. And here's the weird part: all my open tabs for that Domain X have blank favicons, which is super annoying! To make things even stranger, URL autocomplete stops working altogether or gets stuck and doesn't update as I type. On top of that, some UI elements just stop responding - like the Downloads panel button won't open up anymore, and this message keeps popping up saying \"Youtube is now fullscreen\" but it never actually goes away. The good news is that sometimes these issues resolve themselves after a few minutes, but not always. I've tried it on two different PCs (both running Windows 10) with no extensions installed - so it's not like some weird add-on is causing the problem. There's another person who's reported similar issues on the Mozilla forums, but otherwise nobody else seems to be experiencing this.

      "\"I was testing some stuff out and I found this weird issue. I'm using Firefox Nightly 95.0a1 on my Mac with Big Sur 11.6 installed. So, I went to the West Elm website (https://www.westelm.co.uk/) and started clicking around. First, I navigated to one of the top categories like \"Bed Linen\", then I clicked on a different one, say \"Bath\". But here's what happened - instead of seeing the new products loaded up, I just got this annoying spinner thingy going on and nothing else changed. That's not what was supposed to happen! When you switch categories, I'd expect to see the new set of products pop up. But nope, it just stuck on that spinning wheel. I've included a screenshot to show you exactly what I saw. Interestingly, if I disable ETP (which stands for something technical, don't worry about it), the issue goes away. And, funnily enough, this problem doesn't happen when I use Windows - it's only an issue on my Mac with Big Sur.\"\n",

It's like Firefox has decided to freeze up on me! I've tried this on Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.12.6, and Ubuntu 20 - same issue every time. To reproduce the bug, you can follow these steps: launch Firefox, right-click on a new tab to open the Bookmarks Toolbar options, click on one of those sub-menu options (Always Show/Never Show/Only Show on new tab), and then try to add a bookmark or folder from there. When I do that, I expect all the bookmark options to work smoothly, but instead, it just won't let me add anything if the Bookmark toolbar submenu was previously opened.

To reproduce it, you need to have the \"browser.aboutwelcome.templateMR\" preference set to true, then restart Firefox and go to the \"about:welcome\" page. From there, just click the \"Skip this step\" button a few times until you get to the Mobile Cross-Promo screen, then click the link that says \"send yourself a download link\".

      "So, I noticed that when I open a WebSocket connection to the same domain as my web application (on a local network, using .local TLD) but on a different port, there's this noticeable delay before the data starts getting handled. And weirdly enough, it seems like almost all of that time is being spent on DNS resolution - like, my browser is just stuck trying to figure out what this domain name means! According to the Network Monitor dev tool, anyway. What I'm expecting is that this whole DNS thing should be skipped altogether, you know? It's just slowing things down way too much and making it super annoying for users when they're trying to navigate through the app (which opens up new WebSocket connections left and right).

But, we didn't want to just revoke them right away because it would cause problems for our customers who were using those certs in their production services. We did a risk assessment and decided that the risk was low since the info on the certificates was already validated. We decided to wait 30 days instead of 5 to give our customers time to adjust.

So, here's what I did to reproduce it: first, I opened a certificate error page (like wrong.host.badssl.com) to see how Firefox handles the warning. Then, I zoomed in on the page by increasing the font size to 250% or more - that didn't change anything, so I also tried opening the warning page inside an iframe. Still nothing unusual. Next, I narrowed down the browser window to make it really small, and finally, I checked the plain warning triangle. That's when I noticed something off: the top part of the warning triangle is actually hidden! Normally, you'd expect that warning triangle to be fully visible all the time, but in this case, only the bottom part shows up.

What happens is that when you download a localized build (think languages like Tamil or Polish) and visit a webpage with certificate errors, like badssl.com's \"wrong host\" page. Then, if you shrink the browser window to its minimum width and look at the address bar's chiclet (that's the little icon thingy next to the URL), you'll notice that longer strings of text get replaced by ellipses - it happens even on normal-sized screens! And things get worse when you make the window super narrow, because then some of the text can actually disappear entirely. The kicker is that there's no helpful tooltip available when the chiclet gets cut off, which kind of defeats the purpose of having one in the first place.

      "So, I've got an issue with Firefox that I want to report. It happens in the nightly build (version 92.0a1 from August 4th) on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04. To reproduce it, you need to download a localized Firefox build (for example, the Tamil or Polish version), then load up a page that's got a certificate error (like wrong.host.badssl.com). Next, check out the address bar chiclet thingy - you know, the little area where the URL shows up. Make sure it's visible, then shrink the browser window down to its minimum size and take another look at the chiclet. Now, here's what I expect: no matter how small or large the window is, the text in that chiclet should always be readable. But what actually happens is that longer strings get chopped off with ellipses (...) even when you're not on a super narrow screen - it's like the text just disappears! And to make things worse, there's no tooltip available when the chiclet text isn't fully visible.\n",

      "So, I've been noticing this issue with Firefox - specifically with localized builds (like when it's in Tamil or Polish). When you visit a website that shows a certificate error page (think something like https://wrong.host.badssl.com/), and then check out the little address bar thingy (you know, where the URL is displayed?), I found some weird behavior. If you make the browser window super narrow, the text in that bar gets cut off and replaced with ellipses (...) - even if there's plenty of room to display the whole text normally!

      "So, I was trying to use this feature the other day, and it totally broke down on me. What's supposed to happen is that when you select a specific option, the app should display a list of available items in real-time, based on your location. But instead, it just crashes - literally, it freezes up and won't let me do anything else until I close it out. The weird thing is, it only happens when I'm connected to Wi-Fi - if I switch to mobile data or try to use the feature offline, it works fine. I've tried restarting the app a few times, updating it, and even deleting and reinstalling it, but nothing seems to fix the issue.
